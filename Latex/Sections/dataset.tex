The dataset of our choice is presented at \href{https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html}{\textit{this link}}. It is composed of multiple collections of documents, each one containing some reviews, registered between the 1996 and 2018, about a specific kind of products sold on Amazon. This fact makes the dataset suitable for our purposes, since it contains a lot of reviews but also makes it possible to filter the reviews by product category, allowing to eventually focus the analysis on a specific kind of products.

Among all the available collections, we've decided to use the one about \textbf{Digital Music} (can be retrieved at \href{https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon_v2/categoryFilesSmall/Digital_Music_5.json.gz}{\textit{this link}}) since this file contains a suitable amount of reviews (169.781) while still weighting less then 100 MB, allowing us to upload it to a GitHub repository and parallelize the workload.

The documents inside the dataset have the following shape: \\
\begin{verbatim}
{
    "image": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/..."], 
    "overall": 5.0, 
    "vote": "2",
    "verified": true, 
    "reviewTime": "01 8, 2015", 
    "reviewerID": "A36GE53TK8V94L", 
    "asin": "B000T1EJ0W", 
    "style": {"Format:": "MP3 Music"}, 
    "reviewerName": "MysticWolf229", 
    "reviewText": "the theme song to the one and only movie that ...", 
    "unixReviewTime": 1420675200
}
\end{verbatim}

where the fields have the following meaning:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{image}: an array of URLs pointing to the images of the product review;
