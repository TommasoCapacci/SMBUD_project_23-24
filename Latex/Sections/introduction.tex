The dataset we've chosen to use represents a collection of reviews of products sold on Amazon. 
Datasets like this are usually used for \textit{strategic purposes}, such as understanding the customers' needs and preferences, for \textit{marketing purposes}, such as understanding the customers' opinions on a product, or \textit{for sentiment analysis}, such as training a classifier to predict the sentiment of a review based on its content, since information about the review's text is also provided.

In our case, we will consider the first task, since it can be reduced to the problem of writing a suited set of queries and can be also efficiently supported by the database technology we decided to use, which is MongoDB.
One of the main reasons for this technical choice is the fact that the dataset is in JSON format, which is natively supported by MongoDB. 
Moreover, the dataset is composed of a single collection of, possibly, nested documents, which is also a good fit for MongoDB, since it is a document-oriented database, meaning that it is specifically designed to store data as documents instead of relational tables.

We've decided to interpret the task of strategic analysis as the problem of extracting meaningful statistics from the dataset (such as the number of reviews per product, the average rating per product, the review with highest score, ...) which can be then included on the company's reports and used to make strategic decisions.
